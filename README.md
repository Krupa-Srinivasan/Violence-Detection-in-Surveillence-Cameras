# Violence-Detection-in-Surveillence-Cameras

This project implements a violence detection system using deep learning and computer vision techniques to enhance public safety through automated monitoring. Traditional security systems rely on manual human intervention, which can be error-prone, while our approach leverages real-time video analysis for improved accuracy and efficiency.

By integrating spatial-temporal analysis through advanced deep learning models, the system can detect various forms of violent behavior, even amidst the complexities of diverse human actions and contexts. The system is designed to process video footage from CCTV cameras and identify potential threats in real-time, offering a scalable solution for public security.
